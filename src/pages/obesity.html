    <p> Finally, a study titled "effects of plant-based diets on weight status: A systematic review. Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy" found a "<b>Significant weight reduction in the vegan group (of participants)</b>". Our health is something that, as a country, we agreed was far too important to ignore after the pandemic that we were urged to lose weight after seeing the difference it made in our fight against diseases. However, each year the <b>NHS</b> records more and more people being admitted to hospital due to being obese.
